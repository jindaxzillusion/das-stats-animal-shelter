This is the github repository for DAS-project 2, Group 19

Datasets 16-20 come from the Dallas animal shelter. Each of the 5 datasets contain a variety of
information relating to each animal admitted to the shelter. You will have access to the following
variables, recorded by animal admission:

• Animal_type – The type of animal admitted to the shelter

• Month – Month the animal was admitted, recorded numerically with January=1

• Year. – Year the animal was admitted to the shelter.

• Intake_type – Reason for the animal being admitted to the shelter

• Outcome_type – Final outcome for the admitted animal

• Chip_Status – Did the animal have a microchip with owner information?

• Time_at_Shelter – Days spent at the shelter between being admitted and the final outcome.

Task

Imagine you have been asked by the shelter management to investigate the following questions of
interest:

• Which factors influence the number of days an animal spends in the shelter before their
final outcome is decided?

You should conduct an analysis to answer your question using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM).
Following your analyses, you should then summarise your results in the form of a presentation.
